**Animal-Driven Trading for Shelter Donations** 📈💸😺

## 📌 Overview

**Paws-for-Profit** is a web application designed to generate funds specifically for cats at an animal shelter in Vienna by leveraging stock trading strategies. Rather than focusing on a single methodology, this project draws inspiration from classic, human-style trading approaches to explore how they perform in today's AI-driven financial landscape.

The unique twist? Multiple virtual feline traders each manage their own stock portfolios—starting with virtual money. Each portfolio that transitions to managing real funds sponsors a cat at the shelter through a formal sponsorship, which is guaranteed once established, and contributes toward funding the next virtual cat investor.

## 🐱 How It Works

- **Virtual Cat Traders**: Digital feline investors each begin with virtual money portfolios—except for the very first one, which serves as the pioneer.
- **Market Data**: Daily stock prices are stored and managed in a robust SQL database.
- **Trading Strategy**: Drawing from a variety of random, classic human-style strategies, the virtual cats systematically trade stocks based on traditional financial heuristics and indicators.
- **Donations**: Every successful portfolio holds a guaranteed sponsorship for a cat at the shelter and contributes to converting the next virtual cat investor's portfolio from virtual to real money—creating a self-sustaining cycle of support and expansion.

## 💠 Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React app, hosted on Netlify, providing a responsive, intuitive user interface.
- **Backend**: Django-powered API, hosted on Heroku, managing complex business logic, trade decisions, and database interactions.
- **Database**: SQL database for reliable storage and efficient retrieval of daily stock price data.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Provide tangible support and raise awareness for cat welfare at this animal shelter in Vienna.
- Showcase my skills in data handling, full-stack AI engineering, and application deployment.
- Evaluate the long-term effectiveness of various random or classic human-style stock market strategies in a modern, AI-driven financial environment.
